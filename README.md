# Passport Data Extractor

Passport Data Extractor is an Airtable block that uses [Nanonets OCR API](https://nanonets.com/) to extract relevant information from Passport Images that are part of a base.

## Pre-requisites
Create a nanonets account (you can signup for developer access) and add their pre-built passport OCR model into your account.

## How to use the block
1. After installing the block on your base, configure it with the Nanonets API key and model id.

2. Select a table and the field (with passport attachments) to apply the extraction process on and start the extraction.

3. Once the details have been extracted, the user gets the ability to review each of the extracted records.

A demo of the block's functionality can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/vUx2p6dEtt8?list=PLeUD0-i-p8Sn_5GbT6fijjPYd4ipmo1aM&t=872)
